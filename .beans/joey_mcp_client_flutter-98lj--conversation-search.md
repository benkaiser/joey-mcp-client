Add the ability to search across conversations and within a conversation's messages. As chat history grows, users need a way to find past information without scrolling through every conversation manually.

## Checklist
- [x] Add search bar to conversation list screen (search by title and message content)
- [x] Add in-conversation message search (search within current chat)
- [x] Highlight matching text in search results
- [x] Add full-text search index or efficient query to database service
