### Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I connect to an AI model?**
Joey uses OpenRouter to access AI models. On first launch, you'll be guided through an OAuth sign-in with OpenRouter. Once connected, you can select from hundreds of available models.

**How do I set spending limits?**
Spending limits are configured through your OpenRouter account at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai). Joey respects whatever limits you set there.

**What are MCP servers?**
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that allows AI models to interact with external tools and services. You can connect to remote MCP servers over HTTP to give your AI conversations access to services like Google Drive, Slack, email, and more.

**How do I add an MCP server?**
In the app, open the MCP server settings and add the HTTP endpoint URL for your MCP server. You can connect to multiple servers simultaneously.

**How much does Joey cost?**
Joey is a paid app on the App Store and Google Play. The source code is available on GitHub, so you can also build it from source yourself. AI model usage is billed separately through your OpenRouter account.

**What models are supported?**
Joey supports any model available through OpenRouter, including Claude, Gemini, Deepseek, and hundreds more.
